# Drawing-test
Just a beta version for now.
Also worth noting, this might give an error when saving, so just don't panic if you see one. I've tested and it doesn't mean anything.
Don't forget to install the latest version of python - https://www.python.org/downloads/

After downloading the file, go to terminal or command line in the project folder and type 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Or you can just install the requirements by themselves instead, whichever works for you.
